                        While MHAW is an annual campaign, it is also a gentle reminder to actively prioritise and nurture our mental health beyond the week itself. We believe that people should connect with and tautoko/support each other, while continuing the kōrero about mental health and wellbeing year-round.

                        MHAW is our annual campaign that works to help Kiwis understand what boosts their wellbeing and improves mental health. We’ve been running it since 1993 (when not many people wanted to talk publicly about mental health) and we’re so proud of how much its grown.

                    <div class="intiativetext1">
                        We pick a new theme every year because there isn’t just one way to wellbeing and there’s no one-size-fits-all approach that will work for everyone in Aotearoa. Hopefully, every new MHAW adds a new skill, tool or strategy to your wellbeing kete to help you every day and to draw on when times are tough.

                        Pink Shirt Day is an antibullying campaign that celebrates diversity and creates environments where all people can feel safe, valued and respected. Each year, workplaces, schools, organisations and individuals join the movement to make a stand against bullying.

                        Bullying is a serious issue in New Zealand. Every year, one in five workers report they have been bullied at work, and Aotearoa has the third-highest rate of school bullying out of 36 OECD countries. People who identify as part of the rainbow community experience higher rates of bullying, and studies show people who are bullied are more likely to experience mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts.

                        Pink Shirt Day began in Canada in 2007 when two students took a stand against homophobic bullying after a new year 10 student was harassed and threatened for wearing pink. We’ve been celebrating Pink Shirt Day in Aotearoa since 2009 and the campaign grows stronger and larger every year.
