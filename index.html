                            Pink Shirt Day is an annual campaign focused on promoting 
                            kindness and inclusion as a way to eliminate bullying behaviour in 
                            our schools, workplaces and communities. This year’s campaign 
                            reached over 77% of the New Zealand population and 80% of all 
                            schools and kura took part.

                            The funds raised on Pink Shirt Day helped fund InsideOUT to 
                            deliver 45 rainbow inclusive workshops in the last year to schools 
                            around the motu, as well as provide over 160,000 free resources 
                            around bullying prevention to schools and workplaces. We are 
                            now focused on a long-term strategy around eliminating bullying. 
                            The Pink Shirt Day campaign continues to grow every year, and 
                            we know that repeated exposure to the kaupapa is having
